"""G3 RunBudgetV2: ensure_llm_call_budget / consume_llm_call_budget wiring.

These are the shared helpers every native SIX_ROLE_BASELINE subgraph node
calls immediately before/after its one real Provider LLM call (see
adapters/langgraph/agent_kernel.py). The deterministic policy itself
(profile caps, absolute cap, accounting) is already exhaustively unit-tested
in isolation by tests/unit/application/workflows/test_run_budget.py; this
file proves the *wiring* -- that these helpers read/write
state["retry_budget"] correctly and that denial raises before any Provider
call can happen.
